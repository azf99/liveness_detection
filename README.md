# liveness_detection
This project aims to detect whether the fa e infront of a camera is a real one.

# Files:
1. test_code.py: commtainns code that implements facial feature tracking, using mtcnn and eye blinking test, using a pretrained model and haar cascades
2. full_code.py: has an implementation of the full instruction-based interface for the same to detect spoofing
3. eye_status.py: to implement the methods for the open-close cropped eye keras model

# Note:
Project to be updated soon
